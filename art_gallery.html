    <h3 id="art1">- The Starry Night</h3>
    <p><strong>The Starry Night </strong>is one of Vincent van Gogh’s most celebrated masterpieces, painted in <strong>1889</strong> during his stay at the <strong>Saint-Paul-de-Mausole  asylum </strong>in <em>France</em><br> The swirling night sky, ablaze with stars and a glowing crescent moon, conveys intense emotion and movement, contrasting with the calm village below. Van Gogh’s bold brushstrokes and vivid blues and yellows create a dreamlike atmosphere that reflects both his inner turmoil and fascination with the cosmos. <br> The cypress tree reaching skyward adds a <u>sense of connection between earth and heaven, making the painting a profound expression of imagination, spirituality, and psychological depth</u> </p>

    <h3 id="art2">- The Great Wave off Kanagawa</h3>
    <p><strong>The Great Wave off Kanagawa</strong> is a legendary woodblock print <em>created by Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai around <strong>1831</strong></em>. <br>It captures a towering, cresting wave poised to crash down on three fishing boats, with the serene silhouette of <em>Mount Fuji</em> in the background. The dramatic contrast between the wave’s raw power and the distant calm of the mountain symbolizes nature’s duality—both awe-inspiring and indifferent. <br> <em>Hokusai’s use of bold lines, Prussian blue pigment, and dynamic composition revolutionized Japanese art and influenced Western artists, making this piece an enduring icon of global visual culture.</em></p>

    <h3 id="art3">- Tsunami of Time </h3>
    <p><strong>Tsunami of Time</strong> is a conceptual artwork that captures the relentless surge of history crashing over the present. <br>The wave, immense and frozen mid-motion, symbolizes the unstoppable force of change—each crest layered with fragments of memory, culture, and forgotten dreams. <br>Beneath its towering form, fragile boats represent human lives navigating the chaos, dwarfed by the magnitude of time’s momentum. The palette blends deep blues with streaks of gold, evoking both the mystery of the ocean and the glimmer of fleeting moments. <br> It’s a visual metaphor for how the past shapes us, sweeps us forward, and leaves us searching for balance in its wake.</p>

    <h3 id="art4">- Concrete Pulse</h3>
    <p><strong>Concrete Pulse</strong> is a vibrant tribute to the rhythm and energy of urban life, where every wall and alley becomes a canvas of expression. <br>The artwork captures the raw textures of concrete layered with bold graffiti strokes, neon splashes, and cryptic symbols that echo the voices of the streets. <br>It pulses with movement—like the heartbeat of a city—reflecting rebellion, culture, and creativity colliding in chaotic harmony. <br>From subway tunnels to rooftop murals, Concrete Pulse celebrates the spirit of those who turn grit into art and transform everyday structures into living stories.</p>

    <h3 id="art5">- Neon Reverie</h3>
    <p><strong>Neon Reverie</strong> is a dazzling plunge into a dreamworld lit by electric hues and surreal geometry. <br>The artwork pulses with vibrant neon colors—hot pinks, electric blues, and glowing greens—that twist and ripple like thoughts in motion. Abstract shapes float and collide in a space that feels both digital and ethereal, blurring the line between imagination and circuitry. <br>It evokes the sensation of drifting through a futuristic cityscape or a lucid dream, where light becomes language and every glow tells a story. Neon Reverie invites viewers to lose themselves in the rhythm of color and the poetry of pixels.</p>
